                What's ENGL1105?
            </h3>
            	<p>
                Welcome to ENGL1105! The focus of this course will be on <i>Multimodal Communication</i>. Multimodal Communication is communication which  interacts with a variety of different mediums, whether those mediums are digital, textual, sonic, visual, sculptural, etc.. While this will first and foremost be a writing class, my hope is that by the end of the class you will come to understand the variety of mediums and medias with which you regularly engage, and how these mediums can be used to persuade your readers, express your thoughts, and articulate your beliefs.</p>  
 
				<p>ENGL1105 is a small, studio-based course, which means you will spend considerable time writing, workshopping drafts, and discussing with your peers and instructor. There will be few lectures. You are expected to be an active participant in these workshops, and help your peers as much as needed. Understand that Rhetorical Writing is best learned through rigourous practice and collaboration. Oftentimes, you can learn more from your peers than from the instructor.  </p>

				By the end of this course, you will have:
				<ul>
					<li><b>Practiced</b> using language consciously and identifying rhetorical qualities in composing situations.</li>
					<li><b>Engaged</b> in invention, drafting, and rewriting, providing explicit evidence of a writing process.</li>
					<li><b>Demonstrated</b> awareness of academic writing genre conventions, including mechanics and syntax.</li>
					<li><b>Adapted</b> your writing to distinct rhetorical contexts, drawing attention to the way composition transforms across contexts and forms (e.g., visual, oral, and digital).</li>
					<li><b>Applied</b> feedback from instructor, peers, and individual reflection to rethink, re-see, and ultimately revise your work.</li>
				</ul>

The staircase in the main atrium does this strange thing where it goes straight from the 1st floor to the 3rd floor, so you may need to poke around to find another stairwell.
